# SkySportsSample — Modern Rebuild (Next.js + FastAPI)

This repository is being rebuilt as a portfolio-grade full-stack app inspired by Sky Sports:
- Sports news (articles/headlines)
- Live scores (cached + normalized via API)
- Clean UI + real API + database migrations

## Stack (current)
- Web: Next.js (TypeScript) + Tailwind
- API: FastAPI (Python)

## Planned next
- PostgreSQL + Alembic migrations
- Redis caching for external sports API
- CI (GitHub Actions), tests, deployment

## Local dev (coming next commit)
Web: `apps/web`  
API: `apps/api`
